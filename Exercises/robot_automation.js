/*
Imagine you work in a robotic automation factory, and your objective is to write a function
for one of its robotic arms that will dispatch the packages to the correct stack
according to their volume and mass.

Sort the packages using the following criteria:
- A package is bulky if its volume (Width x Height x Length) is greater than or equal to 1,000,000 cmÂ³ or when one of its dimensions is greater or equal to 150 cm.
- A package is heavy when its mass is greater or equal to 20 kg.

Dispatch the packages in the following stacks:
- STANDARD: standard packages (those that are not bulky or heavy) can be handled normally.
- SPECIAL: packages that are either heavy or bulky can't be handled automatically.
- REJECTED: packages that are both heavy and bulky are rejected.

Implement the function sort(width, height, length, mass) - units are centimeters for the dimensions and kilogram for the mass.
This function must return a string: the name of the stack where the package should go.
